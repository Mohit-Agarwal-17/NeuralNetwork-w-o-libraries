# Neural Network from Scratch

## Overview

This project involves creating a neural network from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, without relying on any external machine learning libraries. The goal is to build a deep understanding of neural networks by implementing all components, including the forward pass, backward pass, and optimization processes, manually.

## Features

- **Fully Connected Neural Network**: Implementation of a fully connected (dense) neural network.
- **Customizable Layers and Activation Functions**: Ability to add multiple layers with customizable activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Implementation of gradient descent for optimizing weights and biases.
- **Loss Functions**: Implementation of common loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Functions to train the network and evaluate its performance on test data.
